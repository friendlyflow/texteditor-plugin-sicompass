# Changelog

## 0.3.0

Text Editor is a program of its own now, instead of a sandboxed WebAssembly component.
Sicompass starts it and talks to it, one per tab, and it runs with your rights, so
its entry in the Store says what it does before you install it, and installing it is
your approval.

- Deleting still goes to the trash and can be undone. Opening a very large file reads it whole, as before.
- One build for each of Linux (x86_64 and arm64, static), macOS (Apple Silicon and
  Intel) and Windows.
- Needs a Sicompass that runs plugin programs. An older Sicompass keeps the 0.2
  version it has.
